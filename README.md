# GoFun Parser

GoFun Parser is a tool for converting ARFF files from hierarchical datasets of gene ontology into CSV format. By transforming these datasets into a more modern and accessible format, this parser allows for broader and more efficient research and analysis.

## Overview

The project primarily focuses on converting ARFF files available from the [HMC Datasets](https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/software/clus/hmcdatasets/) into CSV files. This conversion ensures that researchers and practitioners in fields such as bioinformatics and hierarchical multi-label classification can seamlessly use these datasets with a wide range of modern data processing tools and frameworks.

## Features

- Converts ARFF files from hierarchical datasets into well-structured CSV files.
- Preserves the hierarchical and multi-label nature of the data during conversion.
- Designed to support flexible and robust research on gene ontology datasets.
- Lightweight and easy-to-use tool for efficient data conversion.
